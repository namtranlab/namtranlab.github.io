In this project, we employ Grand-Canonical Density Functional Theory (DFT), Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, and Machine Learning techniques to investigate the mechanisms and facilitate the design of Single Atom Catalysts (SACs). Our integrated approach offers valuable insights into the fundamental processes governing SAC behavior and paves the way for the development of high-performance catalysts for various applications
