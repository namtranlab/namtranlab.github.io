Employing Density Functional Theory (DFT), Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD), and Machine Learning (ML) potentials, we investigate the tribochemical reactions between various molecules, including H2, H2O, and O2, with diamond surfaces under diverse working conditions. Our research offers a profound understanding of the underlying mechanisms contributing to the phenomenon of superlubricity in these materials.
